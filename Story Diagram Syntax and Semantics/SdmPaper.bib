     abstract = {In model-driven software engineering, model transformations occur frequently, e.g., to transform platform independent models into platform specific models. Hybrid languages using imperative and declarative elements seem to be a promising approach as they integrate explicit control-flow with efficient matching. Story diagrams are such a hybrid model transformation language that combines UML activity diagrams and graph transformations in a graphical transformation language.
Hitherto, story diagrams do not support structuring complex transformations into several independent story diagrams which can be called in a well-defined manner. This prevents rule reuse and hence significantly reduces the maintainability of the transformations. In this paper, we therefore extend story diagrams by explicit call activities that invoke other story diagrams and support polymorphic dispatching. We evaluate the benefits of such calls by revisiting an already implemented model transformation and discussing improvements due to our new call concept.}

In recent years, the development in the SDM community led to many incompatible meta-models for story diagrams based on the same common concepts. The diversity of meta-models hindered the reuse of tools and limited synergy effects. In this paper, we introduce the new meta-model for story diagrams which was created in joint effort of the SDM community. The new EMF-based model integrates the recent developments and paves the way for the interoperation of SDM tools with each other and with EMF-based tools.}

title={{The  "Physics"  of Notations: Toward a Scientific Basis for Constructing Visual Notations in Software Engineering}},
year={2009},
volume={35},
number={6},
pages={756 -779},
abstract={Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.},
