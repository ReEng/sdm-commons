  abstract = {In model-driven software engineering, model transformations occur
	frequently, e.g., to transform platform independent models into platform
	specific models. Hybrid languages using imperative and declarative
	elements seem to be a promising approach as they integrate explicit
	control-flow with efficient matching. Story diagrams are such a hybrid
	model transformation language that combines UML activity diagrams
	and graph transformations in a graphical transformation language.
	Hitherto, story diagrams do not support structuring complex transformations
	into several independent story diagrams which can be called in a
	well-defined manner. This prevents rule reuse and hence significantly
	reduces the maintainability of the transformations. In this paper,
	we therefore extend story diagrams by explicit call activities that
	invoke other story diagrams and support polymorphic dispatching.
	We evaluate the benefits of such calls by revisiting an already implemented
	model transformation and discussing improvements due to our new call
	concept.}

	Scheduling in Story Diagrams},
  journal = {Sixth International Fujaba Days},

  abstract = {Transformation rules can be controlled explicitly using language constructs
	such as a loop or a conditional. This approach is realized in Fujaba{\textquoteright}s
	Story Diagrams, in VMTS, MOLA and Progres. Alternatively, transformation
	rules can be controlled implicitly using a xed strategy. This approach
	is realized in AGG and AToM3. When modeling transformation systems
	using one approach exclusively, particular aspects could have been
	expressed more intuitively using the other approach. Unfortunately,
	most (if not all) transformation languages do not enable one to model
	the control of some rules explicitly while leaving the control of
	other rules unspecied. Therefore, this paper proposes the extension
	of Story Diagrams with support for implicit rule scheduling. By relying
	on a UML prole and on higher order transformations, the language
	construct is not only executable on the MoTMoT tool, but on any tool
	that supports the standard UML syntax for Fujaba{\textquoteright}s
	Story Diagrams.},

  abstract = {Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software
	engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers
	have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating
	and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed.
	In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics,
	with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no
	design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual
	representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for
	evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for
	visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing
	cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for
	human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design
	theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical
	(perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic)
	properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical
	evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory
	of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate,
	compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct
	new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the
	leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving
	them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence
	from SE and other fields.},

Approaches that use explicit state modelling mostly use bit vectors to represent the states of such systems. Unfortunately, that kind of representation does not extend smoothly to systems in which the states contain values from a domain other than primitive types, such as reference values commonly used in object-oriented systems. In this paper we report preliminary results on applying CTL model checking on state spaces generated using graph transformations. The states of such state spaces have an internal graph structure which makes it possible to represent complex system states without the need to know the exact structure beforehand as when using bit vectors.},

   abstract = {Current and especially future software systems increasingly exhibit so-called self-* properties (e.g., self-healing or self-optimization). In essence, this means that software in such systems needs to be reconfigurable at run-time to remedy a detected failure or to adjust to a changing environment. Reconfiguration includes adding or deleting (software) components as well as adding or deleting component interaction. As a consequence, the state space of self-* systems becomes so complex, that current verification approaches like model checking or theorem proving usually do not scale. Our approach addresses this problem by firstly defining a system architecture with clearly defined components and their interfaces (ports including the definition of signatures of all events and methods which the port may receive and the component may execute) and so-called coordination patterns. These coordination patterns specify communication protocols based on the definition of the ports only for those component interactions which are defined in the (static) architecture specification by a corresponding connection. Secondly, the reconfiguration of architectures is precisely defined by giving a formal definition of all change operations, e.g., adding or deleting components and component connections. By exploiting this formal definition, it becomes provable that an architecture includes only component connections which correspond to the defined coordination patterns. Then, the verification of safety and liveness properties has to be carried out only for each individual coordination pattern rather than for the system as a whole.}
