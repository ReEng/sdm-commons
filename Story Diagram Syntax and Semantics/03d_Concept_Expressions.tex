\section{Expressions (Dietrich)} \label{sec:Expressions}

Story diagrams and story patterns use a mainly graphical syntax.
Though, some things can compactly be described by text, e.g., restrictions of attribute values to a certain range.
For this purpose we added a small textual language for expressions to story diagrams
to cover value comparisons, value assignments, simple arithmetic expressions, etc.
In the first version of this technical report we restricted the expressions to OCL expressions.

In future, this will be extended to also cover arbitrary other textual expressions that have to be interpreted by a given interpreter.
