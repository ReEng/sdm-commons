\section{Expressions (Dietrich)} \label{sec:Expressions}

Story diagrams and story patterns use a mainly graphical syntax.
Though, some things can compactly be described by text, e.g., restrictions of attribute values to a certain range.
For this purpose we added a small textual language for expressions to story diagrams
to cover value comparisons, value assignments, simple arithmetic expressions, etc.
In this first version of this technical report we do not describe expressions in detail.

Besides our small textual language for certain expressions, we support embedding OCL expressions, for example, to determine a value to be assigned to an attribute\footnote{Currently,
the OCL tools in Eclipse (\href{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=ocl}{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=ocl}),
as far as possible, comply with the OMG OCL standard 2.3 (\href{http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/2.3/Beta2/PDF}{http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/2.3/Beta2/PDF}).
We use these tools to interpret the OCL expressions.
More details about this issue can be found here:\\ \href{http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/project-info/plan_indigo.xml&component=Eclipse}{http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/project-info/plan\_indigo.xml\&component=Eclipse}}.
In future, this will be extended to also cover arbitrary other textual expressions that have to be interpreted by a given interpreter.
