\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work (Markus)}

This chapter sums up the report and sketches the future of story diagrams. In addition, we provide an outlook at future versions of this technical report.

\section{Summary}

In this technical report, we presented the endogenous, graphical in-place model transformation language story diagrams. We briefly covered the foundations and explained the most important language concepts, e.g., the idea of story patterns and their concrete syntax or the composition of story diagrams. We illustrated these concepts with a comprehensive example that showed the application of several story patterns for the purpose of removing an interface violation in a program. We also presented a quick survey of related approaches.

The appendix provides the description of a reference implementation of an interpreter for story diagrams. It also contains the technical documentation of the current abstract syntax of story diagrams.

\section{Future Work}

Work on and with story diagrams will continue in the future. The new metamodel for story diagrams which is described in detail in Appendix~C has been proposed quite recently \cite{HRvD+11}. It will definitely be extended and refined. This ensures that story diagrams will proceed to form the basis of scientific approaches in such diverse fields as reverse engineering \cite{DMT10} or verification of embedded systems \cite{HSE10}.

As for this report, future versions will elaborate on advanced concepts in story diagrams, like the use of sub patterns in story patterns, complex expressions, and the application of templates. It will also contain concise portrayals of the different approaches that build on story patterns.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The continuous development of story diagrams and also this report would not have been possible without the support
of all the people that (besides the authors of this report) worked on story diagrams and their various applications over the years.
