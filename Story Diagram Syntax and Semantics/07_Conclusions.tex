\section*{Old stuff from rejected paper}

The specification of control flow has always been an integral part of story diagrams.
However, story diagrams did not support structuring complex transformations into several independent story diagrams up to now. 
In this paper, we described an extension of the existing formalism for the control flow to allow the invocation of other story diagrams, including parameters and return values.
Furthermore, we introduced a concept to polymorphically dispatch a call to the story diagram which matches the actual run-time types of the bound parameters. 

By this means, story diagrams become more flexible and reusable and allow a better structuring of the rule set. 
In a qualitative evaluation, we have discussed that these new features can help to reduce the size of the rule set and increase its maintainability.

As future work, we plan to investigate whether and how the polymorphic dispatching can be extended, for example, to allow arbitrary dispatching conditions similar to QVT-O.
We also plan to evaluate the maintainability, conciseness, and understandability of our approach in comparison to other model transformation languages in an empirical study.
