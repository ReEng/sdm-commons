/*
 * The FUJABA ToolSuite for Eclipse project:
 *
 *   FUJABA is the acronym for 'From Uml to Java And Back Again'
 *   and originally aims to provide an environment for round-trip
 *   engineering using UML as visual programming language. During
 *   the last years, the environment has become a base for several
 *   research activities, e.g. distributed software, database
 *   systems, modelling mechanical and electrical systems and
 *   their simulation. Thus, the environment has become a project,
 *   where this source code is part of. Further details are avail-
 *   able via http://www.fujaba.de

/*
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.6  2006/12/08 18:47:24  fklein
 * Changed imported package to match restructuring in commons4eclipse
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006/05/26 17:24:04  travkin
 * Added another EditPart for diagrams. AbstractASGDiagramEditPart creates
 * a ScalableFreeformLayeredPane as figure and sets the connection router.
 *
 * The UMLDiagramEditPart is an abstract subclass of AbstractASGDiagramEditPart and adds a label figure containing the diagram's name to the pane.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/05/22 17:11:34  travkin
 * Removed most compile warnings.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2006/04/11 17:07:05  travkin
 * Changed some javadoc comments.
