/*
 * The FUJABA ToolSuite for Eclipse project:
 *
 *   FUJABA is the acronym for 'From Uml to Java And Back Again'
 *   and originally aims to provide an environment for round-trip
 *   engineering using UML as visual programming language. During
 *   the last years, the environment has become a base for several
 *   research activities, e.g. distributed software, database
 *   systems, modelling mechanical and electrical systems and
 *   their simulation. Thus, the environment has become a project,
 *   where this source code is part of. Further details are avail-
 *   able via http://www.fujaba.de
